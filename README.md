This repository includes data that were used to perform a meta-analysis of four metagenomic sequence cohorts. The project includs the following main tables:
1) The folder 'OTU read counts' contains the rarefied taxa read count tables for our analysis (vogtmann: Cohort C1; feng: Cohort C2; yu: Cohort C3; zeller: Cohort C4).
2) The folder 'Correlation between taxa' contains the information of the correlation network between differentially abundant bacterial in each cohort. The correlations are inferred with SparCC.
3) The folder 'GO genefamily abundance' and 'KO genefamily abundance' contain the GO (Gene Ontology) and KO (KEGG Orthogroups) genefamily abundance. The unit for the data is counts per million.
4) The folder 'KEGG pathway abundance' includes the KEGG pathway abundance of each cohort. The abundance is estimated from the KO genefamily abundance.
