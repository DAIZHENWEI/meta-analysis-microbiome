Meta-analysis of CRC associated bacteria

This repository includes data that were used to perform a meta-analysis of four metagenomic sequence cohorts. The project includs the following main tables:
1) The folder 'metadata & read counts' contains the metadata and rarefied bacteria species read counts tables for our analysis (vogtmann: Cohort C1; feng: Cohort C2; yu: Cohort C3; zeller: Cohort C4). The species taxonomies are encoded with OTU codes and the corresponding relationship is listed in the file 'Species Taxonomy.csv'.
2) The folder 'Correlation between taxa' contains the information of the correlation network between differentially abundant bacterial in each cohort. The correlations are inferred with SparCC.
3) The folder 'GO genefamily abundance' and 'KO genefamily abundance' contain the GO (Gene Ontology) and KO (KEGG Orthogroups) genefamilies abundance. The unit for the data is counts per million.
4) The folder 'KEGG pathway abundance' includes the KEGG pathway abundance of each cohort. The abundance is estimated from the KO genefamilies abundance.
